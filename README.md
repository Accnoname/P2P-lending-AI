# 🏦 P2P Lending with AI Credit Score (Stacks Blockchain)

This is a **Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Lending Smart Contract** for the **Stacks blockchain**, implemented in **Clarity**. It enables lenders to offer loans in STX, borrowers to apply with AI-assessed credit scores, and repayment in STX or sBTC.

## 🚀 Features
- Lenders create loan offers with STX amount, interest rate, and loan duration.
- Borrowers apply for loans, submitting AI-generated credit scores.
- Borrowers repay with STX; unpaid loans can be liquidated by lenders.
- Transparent loan tracking with smart contract enforcement.
- sBTC & AI Oracle integration-ready (mocked in current version).
